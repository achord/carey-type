# Carey Type

### Carey Type is an open-source font project based on the handwriting of late great New Orleans folk artist Lester Carey.  We will be introducing other font variations at some point in the future. Next up will Be Carey-script. If you would like to become a contributor to this open-source project, please reach out.
